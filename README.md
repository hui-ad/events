📣 HUI-AD Events!

* Sunday, Nov. 1, 2020 - 🦄 We’ve got a special last minute addition to our schedule of events.
  - Two talks on Sunday. One is a preview of @jason_axelson’s Code BEAM BR talk on a visualizing Elixir recompilation. 
  - The other is @sthapa’s talk on Probabilistic Data Structures. 
  - Time chosen to accommodate folks across US time zones. This are going to be some really amazing technical talks, and a great way to learn about some interesting topics.
  - We have Jason Axelson giving a preview of his up-coming Code BEAM talk on a visual tool to understand Elixir recompilation.
  - Also, we have Suchandra Thapa giving a talk titled, “Getting Faster and Smaller By Being Wrong.” Suchandra will discuss probabilistic data structures and how they can improve speeds and memory usage by being (slightly) wrong. These are two exciting talks which we’re squeezing in this weekend to accommodate a tight schedule for the speakers. But, the good news is that it’s at a convenient time for folks in the lower 48 as well.
  - 3-5pm, via Zoom

* Tuesday, Jul. 21, 2020 - 📣 An Anti-Racism.Club update by Jon Lewis and Elixir at Mux with Dylan Jhaveri
  - This week we have two great guest speakers. First up, Jon Lewis will join us to give us a brief update on his project, Anti-Racism.Club. A great resource, Anti-Racism.Club is a growing library of media specifically designed for white communities and allies looking to deepen their anti-racism work through education, thoughtful dialogue, and direct action.
  - Our closing speaker is the talented Dylan Jhaveri, who comes to us from Mux.com to discuss the landscape of video streaming on the internet and how the technologies work. He'll also discuss Elixir and how Mux uses it to power their impressive suite of products. This is a Q&A session with some presentation. Please come with questions, and let's all learn a little bit about Elixir in production!
  - About Jon: Jon is a three time startup founder, emerging technology designer, and a recipient of Apple's App of the Year award. His most recent side project, antiracism.club, is focused on dismantling racism from the inside-out.
  - About Dylan: Dylan is a Senior Software Engineer at Mux, a startup building online video infrastructure for developers. Dylan works on the DevEx team to help developers deliver smooth video to their users. Previously he co-founded Crowdcast, a live video streaming platform.

  - 6pm, via Zoom
* Sunday, May 17, 2020 - Deno intro by Kevin McCarthy, Serverless Video Transcoding by Chris Lee

  - Kevin is going to be sharing some thoughts on Deno (https://deno.land/)!
  - 2pm, via Zoom
* Sunday, April 5, 2020 - Live Coding: DOH COVID Tracker Data Scraper
  - We're planning to do a working session on data scraping the Department of Health website tomorrow afternoon if anyone is interested in participating. Will involve ecto (for storing the parsed data, potentially raw too), phoenix for displaying the parsed data, and some tools for parsing the HTML (probably meeseeks)
  - It’ll be a nice social way to learn how to parse HTML with Elixir (Department of Health data source scraping). You’ll need the Slack app for audio, and the Microsoft Visual Studio Code App installed for Live Share (see Live Share install instructions below).
  - After you’ve got Microsoft Visual Studio Code installed, you’ll need to install the Live Share extensions, the easiest way to get them all is with this pack: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare-pack
  - 1-2pm, via Zoom
* Saturday, March 28, 2020 - Live Coding: DOH COVID Tracker Data Scraper
  - Starting some projects to see how to scrape the COVID data coming from the DOH.
* Tuesday, March 10, 2020 - March Meetup: Demos and discussion
  - Jason will give an overview of Elixir 1.10 and give a few demos (including one that utilizes the new compiler tracing feature)
  - Todd will give a demo of some work that he has been doing with https://github.com/boydm/scenic
  - Then we will move on to general discussion and maybe some group programming
  - 6:30-8:30pm @ HTDC Sandbox, 643 Ilalo St. Honolulu, HI 96813
* Wednesday, Aug. 14, 2019 - Chat Servers with Tony Gaskell: 🎉🎉🎉🎉 Learn all about Elixir and OTP! 🎉🎉🎉🎉
  - Tony Gaskell shall live code a chat server. There will be gen_tcp, there will be chatting. Come learn about Elixir and chat servers.
  - What to expect: You may want to have your laptop set up to write your own Elixir code. If you can, be sure to install Elixir with Homebrew or ASDF before you come. If you need assistance, reach out on Slack or we can help you out at the meeting. If you go with ASDF use this guide to install ASDF and the Elixir and Erlang plugins.
  - 6:30-8:30pm @ HTDC Sandbox, 643 Ilalo St. Honolulu, HI 96813
* Wednesday, Sept. 11, 2019 - Jason Axelson Presents: A Tour of Live-Reloading
  - In this talk Jason will go into how live-reloading (for development) is accomplished in Elixir, the different approaches that libraries and authors use, and demonstrate it using a small scenic app that shows off live-reloading.
  - 6:30-8:30pm @ HTDC Sandbox, 643 Ilalo St. Honolulu, HI 96813
* Wednesday, Oct. 9, 2019 - Magical Pattern Matching: It's why we get up in the morning.
  - Come learn about the magic of Elixir Pattern Matching. It sits along side pipelines in Elixir's fun bag of tricks. We'll start light with lists, tuples, and the pin operator. But, we'll dive deep into structs, maps, the case statement, guards, loops, and recursion.
  - But wait, there's more... Just when you think there's nothing left, we'll take a look at filters and comprehensions, binaries and bitstrings, and a comprehensive look at all Elixir's special forms.
  - 6:30-8:30pm @ HTDC Sandbox, 643 Ilalo St. Honolulu, HI 96813 (Maker Room, 1st floor)
* Tuesday, July 23, 2019 - Planning Meeting: Short & Long Term Goals
  - We gather to discuss future plans.
  - 6:30-8:30pm @ Impact Hub, 1050 Queen St. #100 Honolulu, HI 96814
* Wednesday, July 10, 2019 - Elixir Reboot: This is a reboot of the Elixir meetups
  - A brief intro to Elixir - Unfamiliar with Elixir? We'll let you know what kind of applications it's good for. Unfamiliar with Elixir syntax? We'll do some illustrative live coding.
  - Demoscene! - This will be a 5-10 minute show and tell (per person) showcasing what the community has been up to and what we’re excited about. There have been so many changes since our last meetup!
  - A fun 🧐 Elixir trivia game - Facilitated by Elixir Cards, an amusing way to learn more with your friends. Should be fun for all, and a way for experienced folks to get to know the cards.
  - We'll close with some discussion of what people would like to see next. And, how they might want to get involved, or see the group evolve.
  - Would you like to help out? Everyone is welcome. And you don't need to assist. Coming to soak it all in is fine and welcome. If anyone has questions or suggestions, or would like to help out (@mudphone on HICapacity.Slack.com), please let me know. One of the things I hope to start doing is being more explicit about how people can get involved. So, here are a few of the things I’d like to do, and could use some help with:
    - setting up / tearing down
    - setting up a video chat for remote attendees
    - editing this description, and this site in general
    - refreshments (something simple, drinks, snacks, etc.)
    - publicity (tell your friends!)
  - Finally, if anyone would like to continue conversations after the meetup... It’s been a long time! I’m proposing we head out to some place to eat after (for food and/or beverages). Open to suggestions on locations.
  - 6:00-8:00pm @ HTDC Sandbox, 643 Ilalo St. Honolulu, HI 96813 (Presentation room 201)
