## üì£ HUI-AD Events!

<<<<<<>>>>>><<<<<<>>>>>>

## Next Up: Friday, Dec 18, 6:30pm HST (8:30pm PST)

# [Max Goodhart](https://twitter.com/chromakode) presents, "Transforming Live Video with Web Tech"
What you'll get out of this:
- The core concepts of working with live video streaming
- How Electron and GStreamer can be used to create live video pipelines
- Be inspired to explore web tools in working with video

All welcome! Join us on [Spatial Chat](https://spatial.chat/s/hui-ad) https://spatial.chat/s/hui-ad (spatial audio and video chat)

## Description:

Live video has always intimidated me by its complexity and resource constraints, so I'd not explored it much until this year.

Brief context of [woke.net](http://woke.net) and police brutality protests

I was inspired by this to start building tools to solve the problems of scale woke has. Gradually building up to the current [woke.net](http://woke.net): a self-hosted live video website with our own independent infrastructure creating the video, serving the video, and hosting chat.

In the process I learned a lot of things about how to work with live video as a medium, which made it a lot less opaque. I come from a web dev / JS background, and was surprised to discover how useful and applicable frontend dev is to creating video experiences, and how hosting live video isn't very different from other web tech.

He'll also discuss Elixir and how Mux uses it to power their impressive suite of products. This is a Q&A session with some presentation. Please come with questions, and let's all learn a little bit about Elixir in production!
  - About Jon: Jon is a three time startup founder, emerging technology designer, and a recipient of Apple's App of the Year award. His most recent side project, antiracism.club, is focused on dismantling racism from the inside-out.
  - About Dylan: Dylan is a Senior Software Engineer at Mux, a startup building online video infrastructure for developers. Dylan works on the DevEx team to help developers deliver smooth video to their users. Previously he co-founded Crowdcast, a live video streaming platform.

* Sunday, April 5, 2020 - Live Coding: DOH COVID Tracker Data Scraper
  - We're planning to do a working session on data scraping the Department of Health website tomorrow afternoon if anyone is interested in participating. Will involve ecto (for storing the parsed data, potentially raw too), phoenix for displaying the parsed data, and some tools for parsing the HTML (probably meeseeks)
  - It‚Äôll be a nice social way to learn how to parse HTML with Elixir (Department of Health data source scraping). You‚Äôll need the Slack app for audio, and the Microsoft Visual Studio Code App installed for Live Share (see Live Share install instructions below).
  - After you‚Äôve got Microsoft Visual Studio Code installed, you‚Äôll need to install the Live Share extensions, the easiest way to get them all is with this pack: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare-pack
  - 1-2pm, via Zoom
* Saturday, March 28, 2020 - Live Coding: DOH COVID Tracker Data Scraper

  - What to expect: You may want to have your laptop set up to write your own Elixir code. If you can, be sure to install Elixir with Homebrew or ASDF before you come. If you need assistance, reach out on Slack or we can help you out at the meeting. If you go with ASDF use this guide to install ASDF and the Elixir and Erlang plugins.
  - 6:30-8:30pm @ HTDC Sandbox, 643 Ilalo St. Honolulu, HI 96813
* Wednesday, Sept. 11, 2019 - Jason Axelson Presents: A Tour of Live-Reloading

* Wednesday, Oct. 9, 2019 - Magical Pattern Matching: It's why we get up in the morning.
  - Come learn about the magic of Elixir Pattern Matching. It sits along side pipelines in Elixir's fun bag of tricks. We'll start light with lists, tuples, and the pin operator. But, we'll dive deep into structs, maps, the case statement, guards, loops, and recursion.
  - But wait, there's more... Just when you think there's nothing left, we'll take a look at filters and comprehensions, binaries and bitstrings, and a comprehensive look at all Elixir's special forms.
  - 6:30-8:30pm @ HTDC Sandbox, 643 Ilalo St. Honolulu, HI 96813 (Maker Room, 1st floor)
* Tuesday, July 23, 2019 - Planning Meeting: Short & Long Term Goals

  - 6:30-8:30pm @ Impact Hub, 1050 Queen St. #100 Honolulu, HI 96814
* Wednesday, July 10, 2019 - Elixir Reboot: This is a reboot of the Elixir meetups
  - A brief intro to Elixir - Unfamiliar with Elixir? We'll let you know what kind of applications it's good for. Unfamiliar with Elixir syntax? We'll do some illustrative live coding.
  - Demoscene! - This will be a 5-10 minute show and tell (per person) showcasing what the community has been up to and what we‚Äôre excited about. There have been so many changes since our last meetup!
  - A fun üßê Elixir trivia game - Facilitated by Elixir Cards, an amusing way to learn more with your friends. Should be fun for all, and a way for experienced folks to get to know the cards.
  - We'll close with some discussion of what people would like to see next. And, how they might want to get involved, or see the group evolve.
  - Would you like to help out? Everyone is welcome. And you don't need to assist. Coming to soak it all in is fine and welcome. If anyone has questions or suggestions, or would like to help out (@mudphone on HICapacity.Slack.com), please let me know. One of the things I hope to start doing is being more explicit about how people can get involved. So, here are a few of the things I‚Äôd like to do, and could use some help with:
    - setting up / tearing down
    - setting up a video chat for remote attendees
    - editing this description, and this site in general
    - refreshments (something simple, drinks, snacks, etc.)
    - publicity (tell your friends!)
  - Finally, if anyone would like to continue conversations after the meetup... It‚Äôs been a long time! I‚Äôm proposing we head out to some place to eat after (for food and/or beverages). Open to suggestions on locations.
  - 6:00-8:00pm @ HTDC Sandbox, 643 Ilalo St. Honolulu, HI 96813 (Presentation room 201)
